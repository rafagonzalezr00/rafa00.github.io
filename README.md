I was born in 19th Novembre 2000 and I started my fondness for computers and technologies since I was little.
The life that I have had has been quite hard since it has coincided with the whole period of the crisis that has caused the majority of the world to have economic problems and has caused me to have many restrictions on everything we want to talk about.

# Things I Can do
I liked all relationed with the news technologies, fix, program, edit, mount, all, etc. When I was a little, I loved reparing all the appliances that that broke, apart from that I like to see how the cables are linked with each other.
In programation, I used HTML, JAVA, C# and Visual basic.
